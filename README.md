## ðŸ§  Technical Details

**DocTalk** leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models to provide real-time, context-aware answers from user-uploaded documents. Below is a breakdown of the technical components and models used in this project:

### âš¡ **Model Used**: LLaMA (Ollama)
**DocTalk** uses **Ollama's LLaMA implementation** to deploy the model, which makes the integration seamless and optimized for production use in real-time applications.

- **Prompt Engineering**: To ensure meaningful and accurate answers, **DocTalk** uses a custom **prompt template** that formats user questions and documents in a way that maximizes the model's understanding of the context.
  
### ðŸ§© **Core Technologies**:
1. **Langchain**: 
   - Langchain is used to chain different components together, including document loading, prompt handling, and invoking the LLaMA model. It helps streamline the process of handling different document formats and passing the processed data through the appropriate pipeline.
   
2. **Document Loaders**:
   - **PyPDF2**: For extracting and processing content from **PDF** files.
   - **CSV Loader**: Handles **CSV** file loading and parses data for analysis.
   - **WebLoader**: Uses **BeautifulSoup** and other web scraping techniques to fetch content from provided **website URLs** and extract relevant information.

3. **Output Parsing**:
   - The **StrOutputParser** in Langchain ensures that the responses generated by the model are clean, structured, and directly relevant to the userâ€™s query.

## ðŸ“¸ Sample Output

Hereâ€™s an example of how **DocTalk** works in action. After uploading a PDF or CSV file, you can ask questions about the content. Below is a screenshot showing the sample output when asking a question based on a document:

### Explanation:
In this example, the user has uploaded a **PDF document** and asked a question about the document's content. The AI model has processed the document and provided an accurate, context-aware answer. The system displays the question along with the AI's response in real-time, making it easy for users to extract information quickly and efficiently.

Feel free to try it yourself by uploading your own documents and asking questions to see **DocTalk** in action!

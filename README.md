## üß† Technical Details

**DocTalk** leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models to provide real-time, context-aware answers from user-uploaded documents. Below is a breakdown of the technical components and models used in this project:

### ‚ö° **Model Used**: LLaMA (Ollama)
**DocTalk** uses **Ollama's LLaMA implementation** to deploy the model, which makes the integration seamless and optimized for production use in real-time applications.

- **Prompt Engineering**: To ensure meaningful and accurate answers, **DocTalk** uses a custom **prompt template** that formats user questions and documents in a way that maximizes the model's understanding of the context.
  
### üß© **Core Technologies**:
1. **Langchain**: 
   - Langchain is used to chain different components together, including document loading, prompt handling, and invoking the LLaMA model. It helps streamline the process of handling different document formats and passing the processed data through the appropriate pipeline.
   
2. **Document Loaders**:
   - **PyPDF2**: For extracting and processing content from **PDF** files.
   - **CSV Loader**: Handles **CSV** file loading and parses data for analysis.
   - **WebLoader**: Uses **BeautifulSoup** and other web scraping techniques to fetch content from provided **website URLs** and extract relevant information.

3. **Output Parsing**:
   - The **StrOutputParser** in Langchain ensures that the responses generated by the model are clean, structured, and directly relevant to the user‚Äôs query.

### üîç **How the AI Model Works**:
1. **Document Ingestion**: The application ingests documents in different formats (PDFs, CSVs, or URLs).
2. **Content Processing**: Depending on the input type, **DocTalk** processes the file (e.g., reads content from PDFs or CSVs).
3. **Question-Answering**: Once the document is processed, users can enter a question, and **DocTalk** uses the AI model to extract relevant information.
4. **Model Interaction**: The processed data is passed to the AI model (LLaMA or another chosen model) to generate an answer.
5. **Answer Display**: The AI‚Äôs response is shown to the user in real-time.

### üîë **Key Features**:
- **Real-Time Processing**: The AI processes documents in real time, ensuring users get immediate responses.
- **Advanced Natural Language Understanding**: The LLaMA model provides accurate and context-aware answers to questions based on the uploaded document.
- **Flexible Input Options**: Upload PDFs, CSVs, or provide website URLs to interact with the content.
- **Seamless User Experience**: Built with Streamlit, the interface is designed for intuitive document interaction and query handling.
